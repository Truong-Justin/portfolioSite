# Web Portfolio 


## Project Description
A static, responsive website that showcases my skills and projects. This website was made using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 5, and utilizes the Bootstrap 5 Grid System that enables a mobile-first approach to designing the layout while still supporting a desktop experience. My resume is also on the website itself and can be viewed or downloaded by navigating to the CV page via the CV link in the navbar. Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps is used to host the website. 


## Technology used
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap 5
- Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps


## Planned additions
1. Learning about how to design a compelling and usable front-end is a goal of mine, so I plan to update this portofolio site to demonstrate and practice what I learn. 

2. As I develop more personal projects, I plan to add them to the portfolio site.
