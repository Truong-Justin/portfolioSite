                        This project was made using C# and ASP.Net Core Razor Pages, HTML/CSS, and a SQLite database. This full-stack application lets a user
                        create, read, update, and delete from the SQLite database. In class we were shown how to make a web application using ASP.NET 4.7, an older version of the current ASP.NET.
                        So, in an effort to stay current with the technology currently being used, I decided to create this <span class="text-primary" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Bug Tracker App</span>.

                        <p>
                            A full-stack application that uses a relational database was something that I've wanted to develop for some time. I was also interested in learning about the latest version of ASP.NET offered and practice my front-end skills, and decided to try and develop this project with those goals in mind. 
                            Fortunately, Razor Pages was very similar to ASP.NET Web Forms so the back-end portion wasn't too difficult. However, the front-end portion was more challenging than I expected it to be. This made me go back and review what I thought I already knew about HTML/CSS, which helped me understand how to use
                            CSS Flexbox instead of relying solely on Bootstrap 5 to handle the containers and sizing. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="project_descriptions"><span class=text-primary>What</span> I learned</h2>
                        <p>
                            While developing and debugging this project, there were numerous occassions where the database would lock-up when deployed preventing write-access. I discovered that this is a pitfall of SQLite as it doesn't support concurrent read/write access, but I also discovered that using Write-Ahead Logging
                            could be used to bypass the issue allowing multiple transactions even when the database connection was busy. Working with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages introduced me to the Model-View-ViewModel approach, where I got a better grasp of how to transfer back-end data to the user-facing UI. Finally, I got to practice
                            my front-end skills with those project, and picked up some new concepts along the way like using CSS Flex Box Containers, what the CSS Grid Layout was, and when to use either one.

                        <h2 id="project_descriptions"><span class=text-primary>Planned</span> additions</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I am currently in the process of expanding the number of tables/entities to include tables for:</li>
                            <ul class="mb-5">
                                <li>Project Managers that would lead the project</li>
                                <li>Projects that the bugs would belong to</li>
                                <li>Employees that would be working on the projects</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mb-5">These entities and their associated data access classes will be inherited from abstract classes to support code-reusability and method overloading. This design choice will also be my attempt to include high extensibility, high cohesion, and low coupling. I want to implement these design features so that when 
                                new additions/features are added, major refactoring of the codebase or changes to the underlying architecture won't be necessary.</p>
                            <li class="mb-5">Currently, a SQLite database is being used because it is supported on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. A goal for this project is to keep it OS/platform independent, but I do want to replace the SQLite database with Microsoft SQL Server to better align with the current tech stack used by Microsoft/.NET developers. To accomplish 
                                this, I intend to use Azure SQL to host and manage a cloud based SQL Server database and Azure Key Vault to securely store and access the connection string.</li>
                            <li>As this project is also an application with a focus on UI/UX design, I would like to change the way records are shown to the user when a report is outputted. The information of each database record is placed within a container that is shaped like a long horizontal row. Instead of this design, I would like to implement an interface that will have three vertical sections:</li>
                            <ul class="mb-5">
                                <li>Projects that aren't being worked on yet || Projects that are currently being worked on || Projects that are finished.</li>
                                <li>Bugs that aren't being worked on yet || Bugs that are currently being worked on || Bugs that have been finished.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Finally, I would also like to place the information of each record within a square container like an html card to create a more visually pleasing interface and have each record be stacked on top of each other within the vertical sections they belong to.</p>
                        </ol>
