                    This project was made using C# and ASP.Net Core Razor Pages, HTML/CSS, and a SQLite database. This full-stack application lets a user
                    create, read, update, and delete from the SQLite database. In class we were shown how to make a web application using ASP.NET 4.7, an older version of the current ASP.NET.
                    So, in an effort to stay current with the technology currently being used, I decided to create this <span class="text-primary" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Bug Tracker App</span>.

                    <p>
                        A full-stack application that uses a relational database was something that I've wanted to develop for some time. I was also interested in learning about the latest version of ASP.NET offered and practice my front-end skills, and decided to try and develop this project with those goals in mind. 
                        Fortunately, Razor Pages was very similar to ASP.NET Web Forms so the back-end portion wasn't too difficult. However, the front-end portion was more challenging than I expected it to be. This made me go back and review what I thought I already knew about HTML/CSS, which helped me understand how to use
                        CSS Flexbox instead of relying solely on Bootstrap 5 to handle the containers and sizing. 
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="project_descriptions"><span class=text-primary>What</span> I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        While developing and debugging this project, there were numerous occassions where the database would lock-up when deployed preventing write-access. I discovered that this is a pitfall of SQLite as it doesn't support concurrent read/write access, but I also discovered that using Write-Ahead Logging
                        could be used to bypass the issue allowing multiple transactions even when the database connection was busy. Working with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages introduced me to the Model-View-ViewModel approach, where I got a better grasp of how to transfer back-end data to the user-facing UI. Finally, I got to practice
                        my front-end skills with those project, and picked up some new concepts along the way like using CSS Flex Box Containers, what the CSS Grid Layout was, and when to use either one.
