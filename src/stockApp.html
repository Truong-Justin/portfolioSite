                    This project was made using Python, Plotly and Dash, and the yfinance api. My goal was to make a simple dashboard application that 
                    would output a candlestick chart, standard moving averages, and some commonly used indicators below the main plots. The legend is interactive
                    and displays the 5, 15, 50, and 200 day moving averages along with support and resistance levels when the user clicks on them. Fibonnaci retracement is used to find the 
                    support and resistance levels. The application itself is hosted on <span class="text-warning" style=text-decoration-line:underline>Amazon AWS Beanstalk</span>. Click the button below to see it in action!

                    <p>
                        To better visualize and analyze the trends and price movements of a particular stock, I wanted to make an application that would equip users with 
                        the indicators and moving averages they'd need to implement some basic trading strategies. While trying to make sense of the market myself as a beginner,
                        I found the UI and settings of some applications to be cumbersome or confusing, so I wanted to offer a more streamlined approach that is already preconfigured. 
                        With that in mind, I set out on building and deploying a web application that would accomplish said tasks.
                    </p>

                <h2 id="project_descriptions"><span class=text-primary>What</span> I Learned</h2>
                <p>While developing this stock application, I learned some really interesting things. I learned how to consume data from the yfinance API that pulls its data from the 
                   Yahoo! Finance website. I also got experience with using the built-in functions to plot the interactive candlestick chart using the Plotly graphing library. From there,
                   I learned how to plot multiple subplots on a single page instead of relying on just the single candlestick chart. I chose to make a MACD(Moving Average Cross Divergence) subplot, a volume
                   subplot, and also an RSI(Relative Strength Index) subplot. I came across a few different ways of calculating the RSI and MACD values, and decided to use the <a href="https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#" 
                   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Analysis library</a> to derive the values I needed. Using the Dash framework, I learned how to use a callback function to change the value of the stock choice used to output the graphs, indicators, 
                   and the support and resistance values. Finally, I deployed the working application using Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Github for version control. While deploying the application, I also had to add a configuration file for the load balancer
                   in order to install an SSL certificate.
